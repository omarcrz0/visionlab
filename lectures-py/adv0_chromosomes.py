# # Measuring chromatin fluorescence
# 
# Goal: we want to quantify the amount of a particular protein (red
# fluorescence) localized on the centromeres (green) versus the rest of the
# chromosome (blue).

# Getting the centromeres is easy because the signal is so clean:


# <codecell>

from skimage.filter import threshold_otsu
centromeres_binary = centromeres > threshold_otsu(centromeres)
skdemo.imshow_all(centromeres, centromeres_binary)   


# <markdowncell>
# But getting the chromosomes is not so easy:


# <codecell>

chromosomes_binary = chromosomes > threshold_otsu(chromosomes)
skdemo.imshow_all(chromosomes, chromosomes_binary, cmap='gray')   


# <markdowncell>
# Let's try using an adaptive threshold:


# <codecell>

from skimage.filter import threshold_adaptive
chromosomes_adapt = threshold_adaptive(chromosomes, block_size=51)
# Question: how did I choose this block size?
skdemo.imshow_all(chromosomes, chromosomes_adapt)

# Not only is the uneven illumination a problem, but there seem to be some

# Now that we have the centromeres and the chromosomes, it's time to do the
