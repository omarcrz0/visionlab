# # Segmentation
# 
# 
# Segmentation is the division of an image into "meaningful" regions. If you've
# seen The Terminator, you've seen image segmentation:
# 
# <img src="figs/terminator-vision.png" width="700px"/>
# 
# In `scikit-image`, you can find segmentation functions in the `segmentation`
# package, with one exception: the `watershed` function is in `morphology`,
# because it's a bit of both. We'll use watershed and region boundary
# agglomeration. Functions such as `segmentation.slic` are useful for images in
# which the objects you want to segment have different colors. We won't cover
# them here but you should be aware they exist.

# ## Segmenting with filters
# 
# In many images, the contrast between regions is not sufficient to distinguish
# them, but there is a clear boundary between them. Using an edge detector on
# these images, followed by a *watershed*, often gives very good segmentation.
# For example, look at the output of the Sobel filter on the coins image:


# <codecell>

from skimage import data
from skimage import filters
from matplotlib import cm   


# <codecell>

coins = data.coins()
edges = filters.sobel(coins)

plt.imshow(edges, cmap='gray');   


# <markdowncell>
# The *watershed algorithm* finds the regions between these edges. It does so by
# envisioning the pixel intensity as height on a topographic map. It then
# "floods" the map from the bottom up, starting from seed points. These flood
# areas are called "watershed basins" and when they meet, they form the image
# segmentation.
# 
# Let's look at a one-dimensional example:


# <codecell>

from skimage.morphology import watershed
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

x = np.arange(12)
y = np.array([1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 4, 1, 0])

seeds = ndi.label(y == 0)[0]
seed_positions = np.argwhere(seeds)[:, 0]

print("Seeds:", seeds)
print("Seed positions:", seed_positions)   


# <codecell>

result = watershed(y, seeds)
print(result)   


# <codecell>

# You can ignore the code below--it's just
# to make a pretty plot of the results.
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
ax.plot(y, '-o', label='Image slice', linewidth=3)
ax.plot(seed_positions, np.zeros_like(seed_positions), 'r^',
        label='Seeds', markersize=15)

for n, label in enumerate(np.unique(result)):
    mask = (result == label)
    ax.bar(x[mask][:-1], result[mask][:-1],
           width=1, label='Region %d' % n,
           alpha=0.1)

ax.vlines(np.argwhere(np.diff(result)) + 0.5, -0.2, 4.1, 'm',
          linewidth=3, linestyle='--')

ax.legend(loc='upper left', numpoints=1)
ax.axis('off')
ax.set_ylim(-0.2, 4.1);   


# <markdowncell>
# Let's find some seeds for `coins`. First, we compute the *distance transform*
# of a thresholded version of `edges`:


# <codecell>

threshold = filters.threshold_otsu(edges)
print(threshold)
# Euclidean distance transform
# How far do we have to travel from a non-edge to find an edge?
non_edges = (edges < threshold)
plt.imshow(non_edges)   


# <codecell>

distance_from_edge = ndi.distance_transform_edt(non_edges)

plt.imshow(distance_from_edge, cmap='viridis');   


# <markdowncell>
# Then, we find the *peaks* in that image--the background points furthest away
# from any edges--which will act as the seeds.


# <codecell>

from skimage import feature
peaks = feature.peak_local_max(distance_from_edge, min_distance=10)
print("Peaks shape:", peaks.shape)   


# <codecell>

peaks_image = np.zeros(coins.shape, np.bool)
peaks_image[tuple(np.transpose(peaks))] = True
seeds, num_seeds = ndi.label(peaks_image)

plt.imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
plt.plot(peaks[:, 1], peaks[:, 0], 'ro');
plt.axis('image')   


# <markdowncell>
# We are now ready to perform the watershed:


# <codecell>

ws = watershed(edges, seeds)

from skimage import color
plt.imshow(color.label2rgb(ws, coins));   


# <markdowncell>
# ## Examining the resulting segmentation
# 
# That's pretty good! Some coins are perfectly segmented, with only one missing.
# We can't do much about the missing one (yet), but we can [*merge
# regions*](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_bou
# ndary_merge.html#example-segmentation-plot-boundary-merge-py) to fix the
# remaining coins, and the background. For that we need a *region adjacency
# graph*, or RAG.


# <codecell>

from skimage.future import graph   


# <markdowncell>
# Because *mean boundary agglomeration* won't be available until scikit-image
# 0.13, we have to *monkey patch* the RAG class to use it.

# g is now a *graph* in which each region is a node, and each node links to that
# regions neighbors. The edges have hold properties about the boundary between

# <codecell>

print(g[45])   


# <codecell>

print(g[47])   


# <markdowncell>
# Look at the `skimage.future.graph.merge_hierarchical` API. It's still being
# worked on. That's why it's in `future`, but the future is here! Start using it
# now and send us feedback!


# <codecell>

from skimage.future import graph

graph.merge_hierarchical?   


# <markdowncell>

# define how merging nodes affects the graph. In our case, we want any edges to
# reflect the mean of the pixels at their boundary.


# <codecell>

from skimage.future import graph

    weight_src = graph[src].get(n, default)['weight']
    weight_dst = graph[dst].get(n, default)['weight']
    
    count = count_src + count_dst

                     count_dst * weight_dst) / count

    return {'count': count, 'weight': weighted_mean}

# <markdowncell>

# <codecell>

                                     weight_func=weight_boundary)   


# <markdowncell>
# Let's look at the result:


# <codecell>

from skimage import segmentation
plt.imshow(segmentation.mark_boundaries(coins, seg_coins))   


# <markdowncell>
# We're missing a coin, but otherwise it's perfect! Mean boundary agglomeration,
# as this procedure is called, is simple but powerful!


# <markdowncell>
# ## <span class="exercise">Exercise: The Seeds of Doubt</span>
# 
# Watershed combined with region agglomeration makes a very good segmentation,
# but we missed a coin. How can you improve this?
# 
# We missed a seed, so think of a few other ways to place seeds of an image, or
# to get a finer segmentation at the start. Here's a couple of ideas:
# - find peaks in a Gaussian-smoothed image of the coins, and combine those with
# our original seeds.
# - use a different segmentation algorithm from `watershed`, such as
# `segmentation.felzenszwalb` or `segmentation.slic`, and find its intersection
# with watershed using `segmentation.join_segmentations`.
